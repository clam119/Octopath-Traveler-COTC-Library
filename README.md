# Octopath Traveler - Champions of the Continent Library Project by Christopher Lam

## Introduction
Following on from the previous GitHub project that generated a static JSON Object for the COTC characters, I will be trying to create a fullstack web application that will enable the user to put in the Search Bar Function, the character that they want and the information regarding that character will be displayed. As I will be using MongoDB's schema system, I will be enabling users to essentially create new characters to add to the database. This is so that when new characters in COTC are released, then they will be all available in one location. 

The link to the previous project of generating static JSON Objects with static html forms is here: https://github.com/clam119/Octopath-Traveler---Champions-of-the-Continent-JSON-Generator
## Technology Stack
For this project, I will be mainly using MongoDB (Primarily Mongoose) for the handling of the database, Express/NodeJS for the backend development to handle requests, and EJS, a templating framework to serve up dynamic templating files that will be served to the users for the front-end portion of the project.

## Future Scope
As I plan to learn Front-End Technologies such as ReactJS in the future, I will indefinitely revisiting this project with a proper front-end framework and possibly redesigning the entire project. But, for now being able to add new characters to the library and allow users to edit/delete/filter through the characters to see their favourite characters is the main functionality.
